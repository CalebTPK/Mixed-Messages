# Mixed-Messages

I created this repository for the Mixed Messages portfolio project from Codecademy. The project is a JavaScript program that generates villainous monologues with a touch of chaos. Every run produces a unique combination of openers, villain names, and evil plans to keep things entertaining.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CalebTPK/Mixed-Messages.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd Mixed-Messages
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the project directory in your code editor.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to generate a new villainous monologue.
4. Enjoy the absurdity of your freshly crafted villain monologue!

### Customization

Feel free to customize the arrays in the main.js file to add more elements and increase the variety of generated monologues.

## Additional Features

- **Web Interface:** Convert the project into a web application for a more user-friendly experience.
- **User Interaction:** Allow users to trigger the generation of a new monologue through prompts or buttons.
- **Persistence:** Implement local storage or a backend server for saving and retrieving user preferences.
